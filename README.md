# EzCNC
 New cnc/laser engraver firmware from scratch with cmsis rtos v2

The project was started fairly recently so currently the code is very experimental - acceleration, endstops and abort function aren't implemented.
A lot of mcode and gcode aren't implement also.
Currently only the basic functions work, nevertheless, it does work with laserweb4 in vector and raster modes fairly well.
